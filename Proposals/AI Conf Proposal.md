### Proposal title
Forecasting Using Machine Learning

### Description
Many methods exist for predicting the future values of a series using historical data. Traditionally these methods rely on a single time series. Re-framing forecasting as supervised machine learning allows data scientists to incorporate more features and leverage cutting-edge techniques such as deep learning to improve the quality of predictions.

### Abstract
Time series forecasting is pervasive across many industries such as finance, retail, and transportation. Traditionally univariate models, such as SARIMA are used to forecast a single time series. However, recent advances in machine learning methods allow us to now recast time series analysis problems as supervised learning problems. This has resulted in an increase in accuracy in many time series forecasting tasks.

Using a supervised machine learning framework allows data scientists to use a rich variety of featurizations and modeling techniques. This implies that a machine learning model can learn any univariate model given the appropriate data and featurizations. 

In some domains such as finance and retail it is common to have many distinct, but related, time series that all need predictions at once. We'll explore how using machine learning we can actually share information across different time series.

In this tutorial we'll dive into feature engineering methods such as lag variables, window-based aggregations, and moments that are extracted from continuous, categorical, and textual variables. We'll then explore linear learners, tree algorithms, and deep learning using scikit-learn, Vowpal Wabbit, H2O, XGBoost, and Tensorflow. Finally we'll go over strategies for deploying these models into production.

### Tips for submitting a successful proposal
Pick the right topic for your talk to be sure it gets in front of the right program committee members.
Be authentic. Your peers need original ideas in real-world scenarios, relevant examples, and knowledge transfer.
Give your proposal a simple and straightforward title.
Include as much detail about the presentation as possible.
If you are proposing a panel, tell us who else would be on it.
Keep proposals free of marketing and sales.
If you are not the speaker, provide the contact information of the person you’re suggesting. We tend to ignore proposals submitted by PR agencies and require that we can reach the suggested participant directly. Improve the proposal’s chances of being accepted by working closely with the presenter(s) to write a jargon-free proposal that contains clear value for attendees.
Keep the audience in mind: they’re professional, and already pretty smart.
Limit the scope: in 40 minutes, you won’t be able to cover Everything about Framework X. Instead, pick a useful aspect, or a particular technique, or walk through a simple program.
Explain why people will want to attend and what they’ll take away from it
Don’t assume that your company’s name buys you credibility. If you’re talking about something important that you have specific knowledge of because of what your company does, spell that out in the description.
Does your presentation have the participation of a woman, person of color, or member of another group often underrepresented at tech conferences? Diversity is one of the factors we seriously consider when reviewing proposals as we seek to broaden our speaker roster.

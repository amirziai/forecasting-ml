### Proposal title
Forecasting Using Machine Learning

### Description
(brief overview for marketing purposes, max. length 400 characters—about 65 words)
```
Many methods exist for predicting the future values of a series using historical data. Traditionally these methods rely on a single time series. Re-framing forecasting as supervised machine learning allows data scientists to incorporate more features and leverage cutting-edge techniques such as deep learning to improve the quality of predictions.

### Topic
- [ ] Implementing AI
- [ ] Interacting with AI
- [x] Models and Methods

### Abstract
(Longer, more detailed description of your presentation to help the program committee understand what you will cover. If your proposal is chosen, this is the description that will appear on the website. Note that our copywriters may edit it for consistency and O'Reilly voice.)
```
Using a supervised machine learning framework allows data scientist to use a rich variety of featurization and modeling techniques and libraries. We'll dive into feature engineering methods such as lag variables, window-based aggregations, and moments that are extracted from continuous, categorical, and textual variables. We'll then explore linear learners, tree algorithms, and deep learning using scikit-learn, Vowpal Wabbit, H2O, and Tensorflow. Finally we'll go over strategies for deploying these forecasting models into production. 

- An overview of univariate forecasting techniques (e.g. SARIMA)
- Re-framing forecasting as supervised machine learning
- Featurization for continuous, categorical, and textual time series
- Implementation in a number of machine learning libraries including scikit-learn, Keras, Vowpal Wabbit and H2O 
```

### Audience level
```
- [ ] Beginner
- [x] Intermediate
- [ ] Advanced
```

### What's the takeaway for the audience?
Main ideas and/or skills attendees will learn from your presentation
```
- Overview of univariate forecasting methods

```

### Prerequisite knowledge for this presentation
This information is crucial for attendees. Please describe what skills and knowledge attendees need to have in order to get the most from your talk.
```
- Basics of data wrangling, feature engineering, and machine learning
- Familiarity with a machine learning library
```

### Hardware and/or installation requirements for attendees 
If you are submitting a proposal for a 3-hour tutorial, what materials or downloads will attendees need in advance of your tutorial (e.g., a GitHub account, most current version of MySQL, a laptop, etc.)?
```
A laptop with the following software and packages installed:
- Python 3 (Anaconda distribution)
- Jupyter
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- H2O
- Scikit-learn
- Vowpal Wabbit

A Docker image will be provided to the attendees closer to the date of the conference.
```

### Video URL 
While not required, we strongly encourage you to provide at least one video clip of the speaker. If you don’t have video of the speaker in action at an event, please create a very short clip (2-3 minutes) proposing the session. We don’t care about the quality of the video; we care about the quality of the speakers. If your video isn’t already online, post it to a third-party site (YouTube is fine), and then share the link with us.

### Tips for submitting a successful proposal
Pick the right topic for your talk to be sure it gets in front of the right program committee members.
Be authentic. Your peers need original ideas in real-world scenarios, relevant examples, and knowledge transfer.
Give your proposal a simple and straightforward title.
Include as much detail about the presentation as possible.
If you are proposing a panel, tell us who else would be on it.
Keep proposals free of marketing and sales.
If you are not the speaker, provide the contact information of the person you’re suggesting. We tend to ignore proposals submitted by PR agencies and require that we can reach the suggested participant directly. Improve the proposal’s chances of being accepted by working closely with the presenter(s) to write a jargon-free proposal that contains clear value for attendees.
Keep the audience in mind: they’re professional, and already pretty smart.
Limit the scope: in 40 minutes, you won’t be able to cover Everything about Framework X. Instead, pick a useful aspect, or a particular technique, or walk through a simple program.
Explain why people will want to attend and what they’ll take away from it
Don’t assume that your company’s name buys you credibility. If you’re talking about something important that you have specific knowledge of because of what your company does, spell that out in the description.
Does your presentation have the participation of a woman, person of color, or member of another group often underrepresented at tech conferences? Diversity is one of the factors we seriously consider when reviewing proposals as we seek to broaden our speaker roster.
